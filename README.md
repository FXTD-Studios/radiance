## ◎ What's New - v2.3.3

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **32-Bit Scene-Linear Engine**  
> Radiance preserves full IEEE 754 floating-point precision across the entire chain. Zero banding. Zero data loss.

- **Smart Overwrite Protection** — `Radiance Write` and `EXR Save` now feature automated index detection to prevent accidental file destruction.
- **Universal Digital Cinema I/O** — Consolidated Video, Image Sequence, and Single Image handling into a high-performance unified pipeline.
- **Robust Pipeline Validation** — Enhanced null-safety and input checking for high-load production environments.
- **Terminal HUD & Live REPL** — Nuke-style Python interaction directly inside the viewer for real-time data inspection.
- **Interactive Mask Editor** — Non-destructive brush masking in `◎ Radiance Load Image`.
- **◎ Radiance Grade Match** — Shot-to-shot color statistics transfer using CIE L\*a\*b\* mean/std math.

## <a name="getting-started"></a>◎ Getting Started

![Radiance Workspace](radiance_workspace.png)

The **Radiance Workspace** node is the command center for your production. It handles project paths, versioning, and state management, ensuring that all 32-bit data is tracked correctly across your workflow.

1. **Add the Workspace Node**: Right-click > Radiance > Project > Radiance Workspace.
2. **Set your Project Path**: Point it to your production directory.
3. **Connect to Viewer**: Link the `workspace` output to the Radiance Viewer to enable live telemetry and Python REPL.

## <a name="quick-start"></a>◎ Quick Start Workflows

![Basic Radiance Workflow](basic_workflow.png)

---

## <a name="installation"></a>◎ Installation

### Option 1: ComfyUI Manager
1. Open **ComfyUI Manager**
2. Search for **Radiance**
3. Click **Install**

### Option 2: Manual (Git)
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/fxtd-studios/radiance.git
cd radiance
pip install -r requirements_windows.txt  # Or linux/mac_silicon
```

> [!TIP]
> **Linux/macOS Users**: Ensure you have `libopenexr-dev` installed via your package manager before running the requirements install.

---

## ◎ Troubleshooting

### ComfyUI Manager Security Level
If ComfyUI Manager refuses to install Radiance because only the default channel is allowed, install manually with Git:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/fxtd-studios/radiance.git
cd radiance
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Restart ComfyUI after installation. If you use a platform-specific requirements file, choose `requirements_windows.txt`, `requirements_linux.txt`, or `requirements_mac_silicon.txt`.

### Dependency Conflicts
Radiance avoids strict upper version caps where possible so ComfyUI and other custom nodes can resolve shared packages. If another extension conflicts, reinstall Radiance dependencies last, then restart ComfyUI.

### EXR / HDR Saving
Use `◎ Radiance Write`, `◎ Radiance Save EXR`, or `◎ Save Image 16-bit` for managed outputs. Radiance writes non-overwriting filenames and reports saved files to ComfyUI history so API users can discover generated outputs from prompt history.

For EXR support, Radiance sets `OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR=1` at import time, but the Python EXR packages must still be installed. On Linux, install the system OpenEXR development package before `pip install -r requirements_linux.txt`.

### Viewer Export
The viewer preview is interactive. To bake the result, run the workflow first, open the Radiance Viewer controls, then use the delivery/export controls. Grain, bloom, halation, diffusion, and denoise are baked by the delivery path; purely interactive display/navigation overlays are not part of the source image.

### 32-Bit HDR Expectations
Radiance preserves 32-bit float values when upstream data contains them. It cannot recover highlight or shadow detail that was already clipped in an 8-bit source image. For true HDR workflows, start from EXR/HDR, scene-linear, or float outputs where possible.

### Viewer And Lens Controls
`◎ Radiance Viewer` is the current viewer node. Legacy workflows that reference the older Pro Viewer name are mapped to the current viewer. Lens effects are in the Viewer Lens tab; use 32-bit mode for the widest HDR preview range and use the Strong Preview preset when tuning bloom, halation, and anamorphic streaks.

### Old Workflows
Use the `.rad` workflows in the `workflows/` folder for current node layouts. Very old JSON workflows may contain stale widget order or renamed nodes and should be rebuilt or imported through the current Radiance Workspace tools.
